# RADS v0.0.2 - Release Plan

This document outlines the features and priorities for the v0.0.2 release of the RADS language. The focus of this release is to stabilize and complete the core language features, improve the developer experience with better error handling, and expand the standard library with essential modules.

---

### **High Priority: Core Language & Stability**

These features are essential for making RADS a more usable and robust language.

1.  **Complete Core Language Features:**
    *   **Structs and Enums:** The spec mentions them, but the roadmap says they are not implemented. This is a fundamental feature for any real programming.
    *   **Arrays and Dynamic Arrays:** The roadmap says "partial implementation". Let's make them fully functional with methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.length`.
    *   **String Manipulation:** The `+` operator for concatenation is a must-have. A core set of string functions (e.g., `split`, `join`, `trim`) is also very important.
    *   **Modules/Imports:** A basic `import` system to allow code to be split across multiple files.

2.  **Improved Error Handling:**
    *   The `V0.0.1_PLAN.md` had great ideas for this. We don't need to implement all of it, but better error messages with line numbers and context would be a huge win for usability.

3.  **Basic Standard Library Modules:**
    *   **`math`:** Implement the basic math functions proposed in the roadmap. This is a quick win.
    *   **`fs` (File System):** Expand beyond just reading/writing files. Add `list_dir`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, etc.

### **Medium Priority: Developer Experience & Tooling**

These features will make RADS easier and more enjoyable to use.

1.  **Enhanced REPL:**
    *   The current REPL is very basic. Adding history (arrow keys) and multi-line input would be a significant improvement.

2.  **Working Package Manager (RADStar):**
    *   Implement the basic `rstar install` command to fetch packages from a git repository. This would be a huge step towards building an ecosystem.

3.  **Async/Await Foundation:**
    *   The spec mentions `async/await`, and the roadmap has it in "Phase 3". For `v0.0.2`, we could focus on implementing the basic event loop and `await` for I/O operations (like reading a file asynchronously).

### **Low Priority: Ambitious Features (maybe for v0.0.3)**

These are bigger features that might be too much for a `v0.0.2` release, but are good to keep in mind.

1.  **Database Drivers:** As mentioned in the `V0.0.1_PLAN.md` post-release plan.
2.  **Full Web Framework (RadsWeb):** This is a big project. We could aim for a more basic HTTP server first.
3.  **Debugger and VS Code Extension:** These are significant undertakings that require a stable core language first.
