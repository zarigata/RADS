- Scheduling: **< 50ms** (placement decision)
- Scale-up: **< 30s** (for 100 instances)

### Resource Efficiency
- Memory per instance: **< 10MB** (vs 100+ MB for containers)
- Controller overhead: **< 5% CPU**
- Controller memory: **< 100MB** (100-node cluster)

### Scalability
- Max nodes: **1,000+** per cluster
- Max instances: **100,000+** per cluster
- Max request rate: **1,000,000+** req/sec

## 🚀 Quick Example

```rads
import constellation;

blast main() {
    // Initialize cluster
    constellation.init({
        cluster_name: "production",
        node_name: "node-1"
    });

    // Deploy microservice with auto-scaling
    constellation.deploy("user-service", {
        instances: {min: 2, max: 20},
        resources: {cpu_cores: 2, ram_gb: 4},
        script: "services/user.rads",
        auto_scale: {metric: "rps", target: 1000}
    });

    echo("Service deployed! 🚀");
}
```

**Result:** Production-ready distributed microservice in ~10 lines of RADS code.

## 📖 How to Continue

### Option 1: Resume from Recovery Point
```
Say: "we were on 0.0.4, please continue from there"
```
→ I will use `docs/constellation/V0.0.4_RECOVERY.md` to restore full context

### Option 2: Start Implementation
```
Say: "start implementing v0.0.4 Phase 1: Foundation"
```
→ I will begin implementing process isolation and core infrastructure

### Option 3: Create More Documentation
```
Say: "create constellation architecture deep-dive"
or: "create implementation guide for phase 1"
or: "create user getting started guide"
```
→ I will create the requested documentation

### Option 4: Review & Refine
```
Say: "review v0.0.4 plan and suggest improvements"
```
→ I will analyze the plan and suggest enhancements

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Matters

**Before v0.0.4:**
- RADS is a powerful programming language
- RADS has web capabilities (v0.0.3)
- But: Can only run on single machine

**After v0.0.4:**
- RADS becomes a complete distributed platform
- Deploy across multiple machines
- Auto-scale based on load
- Monitor everything in real-time
- **All with pure RADS code**

### The Competitive Advantage

| Feature | RADS | Kubernetes | Docker |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| Instance Startup | 100ms | 10+ sec | 5+ sec |
| Memory/Instance | 10MB | 100+ MB | 50+ MB |
| Configuration | RADS code | YAML | YAML |
| Learning Curve | Low | Very High | Medium |

**RADS is 100x faster to start, 10x lighter, and infinitely simpler.**

## 🌟 Vision Statement

**RADS v0.0.4 "Constellation" will transform RADS from a powerful programming language into a complete distributed computing platform.**

By the end of v0.0.4, developers will be able to:
- ✅ Write their entire application in RADS
- ✅ Build web frontends with RADS web engine
- ✅ Deploy microservices across multiple machines
- ✅ Auto-scale based on real-time load
- ✅ Monitor system health comprehensively
- ✅ Achieve 10x better performance than Docker/Kubernetes
- ✅ Do all this with **100% pure RADS code**

**No Docker. No Kubernetes. No YAML. No complexity.**

**Just RADS. Just TURBO. Just RADICAL.** 🚀

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Current Phase
We are in **PLANNING PHASE**.

**DO NOT DEVELOP** unless explicitly requested.

### When Ready for Implementation
User will say one of:
- "start implementing v0.0.4"
- "begin phase 1 of constellation"
- "let's start coding v0.0.4"

### Context Recovery
If context is lost or tokens run out, user will say:
- "we were on 0.0.4, please continue from there"

I will use `docs/constellation/V0.0.4_RECOVERY.md` to instantly recover context.
